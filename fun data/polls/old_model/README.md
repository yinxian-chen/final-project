On June 28, 2023, we debuted a new way of calculating our polling averages. You can read the full [methodology](https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-polling-averages-work/) on our website.

At that time, we changed all our polling averages that were actively updating to use the new methodology. This directory contains the polling averages as generated by the previous model and published prior to June 28, 2023.
